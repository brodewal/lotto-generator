# lotto-generator
This is a very first version of a toy Web server to experiment with the JS framework Meteor.
This can generate and display a set of numbers, like that generated in a lottery. For example, this can generate a set in sorted order of numbers between 1 and 49. This also generates a bonus ball.

Refreshing the page generates a new set.

To run:
cd lotto-generator
meteor

http://localhost:3000/
